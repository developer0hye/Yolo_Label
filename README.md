 In the world, there are many good image labeling tools for object detection. -e.g. , ([Yolo_mark](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark), [BBox-Label-Tool](https://github.com/puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool), [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)). 
 
But... I reinvented it...
 
## WHY DID YOU REINVENTED THE WHEEL? ARE YOU STUPID?

 When I use the pre-existing program to annotate a training set for YOLO V3, I am sooooooooooo bored...
 
 So I thought about why it is so fxxking bored??

 And I found that anwer.
 
 The answer is that pre-existing programs are not **sensitive**.
 
 So I decided to make a **sesnsitive** image labeling tool for object detection.
 
 ## SHOW ME YOUR SENSITIVE IMAGE LABELING TOOL!!

 See the below picture! It's the **SENSITIVE** image labeling tool for object detection!

 ## HMM... I SAW THIS DESIGN SOMEWHERE
  I refered to https://pjreddie.com/darknet/, which is the website of Joseph Redmon who invented the [YOLO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPU2HistivI).
